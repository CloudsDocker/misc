# Cloud computing
Cloud computing is an approach to computing that builds on virtualization's efficient **pooling of resources** to create an on-demand, elastic, self-managing virtual infrastructure that can be **allocated dynamically as a service**. Virtualization uncouples applications and information <u>from the complexity of the underlying hardware infrastructure</u>.

Virtualization, in addition to being the underlying technology for cloud computing, enables organizations of all sizes to make improvements in the areas of **flexibility and cost containment**. For example, with server consolidation, one physical server takes on the work of many servers by incorporating multiple servers as virtual machines. Also, ease of management and effective resource use are products of virtualizing the datacenter. When you virtualize your datacenter, management of the infrastructure becomes easier and you use your available infrastructure resources more effectively. Virtualization enables you to create a dynamic and flexible datacenter, and can reduce operating expenses through automation while also **reducing planned and unplanned downtime**.

VMware vSphere **virtualizes and aggregates the underlying physical hardware resources across multiple systems and provides pools of virtual resources to the datacenter**.
Virtualization is a process that breaks the hard connection between the physical hardware and the operating system and applications running on it. After being virtualized in a vSphere virtual machine, the operating system and applications are no longer constrained by the limits imposed by residing on a single physical machine.
