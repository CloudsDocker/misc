Customer-first and think-as-owner are always first principle in my phylosophy. I was considered as a dependable go-to person and SME when working with customers.



At AWS, customer obsession is in our DNA. As a trusted advisor to our customers and partners you will work with AWS sales, business development, solutions architecture and product teams to craft highly scalable, flexible and resilient cloud architectures that address customer business problems and accelerate the adoption of AWS services.

As a successful Solution Architect you will not only deliver on our credo of "Work hard. Have fun. Make history" you will love what you do and your enthusiasm will be contagious across our teams and customers.

In return we provide you the chance to work with some of the smartest minds from around the world who are leading the way in cloud based architecture design. On a daily basis you will be challenged to think differently, learn more, and build elegant solutions.

If you are highly technical and experienced in architecting or deploying Cloud/Virtualization solutions in enterprise customers then this could be the role for you. Remember, this is a client facing role so you must be comfortable talking with CIOs, CTOs and CISOs. It goes without saying that you must have experience in  architecting infrastructure solutions using both Linux/Unix and Windows with specific recommendations on server, load balancing, HA/DR, networking & storage architectures. Couple all that with a baseline knowledge of or even certification in AWS and this role is made for you!
