In some system distributions, sudo has largely supplanted the default use of a distinct superuser login for administrative tasks, most notably in some Linux distributions as well as Apple's Mac OS X.[14][15]

visudo is a command-line utility that allows editing the configuration file in a fail-safe manner. It prevents multiple simultaneous edits with locks and performs sanity and syntax checks.
