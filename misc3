---WAS-
Simply put, a profile contains an Application Server.
When an Application Server is running, the server process may read and write data to the underlying configuration files and logs. So, by using profiles, transient data is kept away from the base product. This allows us to have more than one profile using the same base binaries, and also allows us to remove certain profiles without affecting other profiles. Another reason for separating the base binaries is that we can upgrade the product with maintenance updates and fix packs without having to re-create all profiles. Sometimes you do not want a specific profile to be updated. WAS profile management has been designed for flexibility.

WAS has the ability to have multiple application server definitions using the same underlying base binaries. Each profile defines the attributes and configurations for a given application server.
Each standalone application server can optionally have its own administrative console application, which you use to manage the application server.
We will cover how to install a profile later in the chapter.

On distributed platforms, profiles are created after you install the product by using either the Profile Management Tool or the manageprofiles command.
